=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Bio::EnsEMBL::Utils::Scalar qw(check_ref assert_ref wrap_array check_ref_can assert_ref_can assert_numeric assert_integer);

	check_ref([], 'ARRAY'); # Will return true
	check_ref({}, 'ARRAY'); # Will return false
	check_ref($dba, 'Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::DBAdaptor'); #Returns true if $dba is a DBAdaptor

	assert_ref([], 'ARRAY'); #Returns true
	assert_ref({}, 'ARRAY'); #throws an exception
	assert_ref($dba, 'Bio::EnsEMBL::Gene'); #throws an exception if $dba is not a Gene

	wrap_array([]); #Returns the same reference
	wrap_array($a); #Returns [$a] if $a was not an array
	wrap_array(undef); #Returns [] since incoming was undefined
	wrap_array(); #Returns [] since incoming was empty (therefore undefined)

	check_ref_can([], 'dbID'); #returns false as ArrayRef is not blessed
	check_ref_can($gene, 'dbID'); #returns true as Gene should implement dbID()
	check_ref_can(undef); #Throws an exception as we gave no method to test

	assert_ref_can([], 'dbID'); #throws an exception since ArrayRef is not blessed
	assert_ref_can($gene, 'dbID'); #returns true if gene implements dbID()

=head2 check_ref()

  Arg [1]     : The reference to check
  Arg [2]     : The type we expect
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given object/ref is
                what you expect. If you give it a blessed reference then it
                will perform an isa() call on the object after the defined
                tests. If it is a plain reference then it will use ref().

                An undefined value will return a false.
  Returntype  : Boolean indicating if the reference was the type we
                expect
  Example     : my $ok = check_ref([], 'ARRAY');
  Exceptions  : If the expected type was not set
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub check_ref {
	my ($ref, $expected) = @_;
	throw('No expected type given') if ! defined $expected;
	if(defined $ref) {
		if(blessed($ref)) {
			return 1 if $ref->isa($expected);
		}
		else {
			my $ref_ref_type = ref($ref);
			return 1 if defined $ref_ref_type && $ref_ref_type eq $expected;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}

=head2 assert_ref()

  Arg [1]     : The reference to check
  Arg [2]     : The type we expect
  Arg [3]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given object/ref is
                what you expect. This behaves in an identical manner as
                C<check_ref()> does except this will raise exceptions when
                the values do not match rather than returning a boolean
                indicating the situation.

                Undefs cause exception circumstances.
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we managed to get to the return
  Example     : assert_ref([], 'ARRAY');
  Exceptions  : If the expected type was not set and if the given reference
                was not assignable to the expected value
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub assert_ref {
  my ($ref, $expected, $attribute_name) = @_;
  $attribute_name ||= '-Unknown-';
  throw('No expected type given') if ! defined $expected;
  my $class = ref($ref);
  throw("The given reference for attribute $attribute_name was undef") unless defined $ref;
  throw("Asking for the type of the attribute $attribute_name produced no type; check it is a reference") unless $class;
  if(blessed($ref)) {
    throw("${attribute_name}'s type '${class}' is not an ISA of '${expected}'") if ! $ref->isa($expected);
  }
  else {
    throw("$attribute_name was expected to be '${expected}' but was '${class}'") if $expected ne $class;
  }
  return 1;
}

=head2 wrap_array()

  Arg         : The reference we want to wrap in an array
  Description : Takes in a reference and returns either the reference if it
                was already an array, the reference wrapped in an array or
                an empty array (if the given value was undefined).
  Returntype  : Array Reference
  Example     : my $a = wrap_array($input);
  Exceptions  : None
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub wrap_array {
  my ($incoming_reference) = @_;
  if(defined $incoming_reference) {
    if(check_ref($incoming_reference, 'ARRAY')) {
      return $incoming_reference;
    }
    else {
      return [$incoming_reference];
    }
  }
  return [];
}

=head2 check_ref_can

  Arg [1]     : The reference to check
  Arg [2]     : The method we expect to run
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given object/ref is
                implements the given method. This is very similar to the
                functionality given by C<UNIVERSAL::can()> but works
                by executing C<can()> on the object meaning we consult the
                object's potentially overriden version rather than Perl's
                default mechanism.
  Returntype  : CodeRef
  Example     : check_ref_can($gene, 'dbID');
  Exceptions  : If the expected type was not set.
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub check_ref_can {
  my ($ref, $method) = @_;
  throw('No method given') if ! defined $method;
  return unless defined $ref && blessed($ref);
  return $ref->can($method);
}

=head2 assert_ref_can

  Arg [1]     : The reference to check
  Arg [2]     : The method we expect to run
  Arg [3]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given object/ref is
                implements the given method. Will throw exceptions.
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we managed to get to the return
  Example     : assert_ref_can($gene, 'dbID');
  Exceptions  : If the reference is not defined, if the object does not
                implement the given method and if no method was given to check
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub assert_ref_can {
  my ($ref, $method, $attribute_name) = @_;
  $attribute_name ||= '-Unknown-';
  throw('No method given') if ! defined $method;
  throw "The given reference $attribute_name is not defined" unless defined $ref;

=head2 assert_numeric

  Arg [1]     : The Scalar to check
  Arg [2]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given scalar is
                number or not. If not then we raise exceptions detailing why
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we had a numeric otherwise we signal failure
                via exceptions
  Example     : assert_numeric(1, 'dbID');
  Exceptions  : If the Scalar is not defined, if the Scalar was blessed and
                if the value was not a number
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub assert_numeric {
  my ($integer, $attribute_name) = @_;

=head2 assert_integer

  Arg [1]     : The Scalar to check
  Arg [2]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given scalar is
                a whole integer; we delegate to L<assert_numeric> for number
                checking.
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we had a numeric otherwise we signal failure
                via exceptions
  Example     : assert_integer(1, 'dbID');
  Exceptions  : See L<assert_numeric> and we raise exceptions if the value
                was not a whole integer
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub assert_integer {
  my ($integer, $attribute_name) = @_;

}

=head2 assert_boolean

  Arg [1]     : The Scalar to check
  Arg [2]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given scalar is
                a boolean i.e. value is set to C<1> or C<0>
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we were given a boolean otherwise we signal
                failure via exceptions
  Example     : assert_boolean(1, 'is_circular');
  Exceptions  : See L<assert_integer> and we raise exceptions if the value
                was not equal to the 2 valid states
  Status      : Stable

=cut

sub assert_boolean {
  my ($boolean, $attribute_name) = @_;

  Arg [1]     : The Scalar to check
  Arg [2]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given scalar is
                a whole integer and if the value is set to C<1>, C<0> or C<-1>
  Returntype  : Boolean; true if we had a strand integer otherwise we signal
                failure via exceptions
  Example     : assert_strand(1, 'strand');
  Exceptions  : See L<assert_integer> and we raise exceptions if the value
                was not equal to the 3 valid states

=head2 assert_file_handle

  Arg [1]     : The Scalar to check
  Arg [2]     : The attribute name you are asserting; not required but allows
                for more useful error messages to be generated. Defaults to
                C<-Unknown->.
  Description : A subroutine which checks to see if the given scalar is
                actually a file handle. This will handle those which are Glob
                references and those which inherit from C<IO::Handle>. It will
                also cope with a blessed Glob reference.
  Returntype  : Boolean;
  Example     : assert_file_handle($fh, '-FILE_HANDLE');
  Exceptions  : Raised if not defined, not a reference and was not a
                GLOB or did not inherit from IO::Handle
