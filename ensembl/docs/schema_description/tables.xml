  <introduction>
    <text>This document gives a high-level description of the tables that make up the EnsEMBL core schema. Tables are grouped into logical groups, and the purpose of each table is explained. It is intended to allow people to familiarise themselves with the schema when encountering it for the first time, or when they need to use some tables that they've not used before. Note that while some of the more important columns in some of the tables are discussed, this document makes no attempt to enumerate all of the names, types and contents of every single table. Some concepts which are referred to in the table descriptions are given at the end of this document; these are linked to from the table description where appropriate.</text>
    <process intro="Different tables are populated throughout the gene build process:">
      <step number="0">Create empty schema, populate meta table</step>
      <step number="1">Load DNA - populates dna, clone, contig, chromosome, assembly tables</step>
      <step number="2">Analyze DNA (raw computes) - populates genomic feature/analysis tables</step>
      <step number="3">Build genes - populates exon, transcript,etc. gene-related tables</step>
      <step number="4a">Analyze genes - populate protein_feature, xref tables, interpro</step>
      <step number="4b">ID mapping</step>

    <table>
      
      <name>seq_region</name>

      <description>Stores information about sequence regions. The primary key is used as a pointer into the dna table so that actual sequence can be obtained, and the coord_system_id allows sequence regions of multiple types to be stored. Clones, contigs and chromosomes are all now stored in the seq_region table. Contigs are stored with the co-ordinate system 'contig'. The relationship between contigs and clones is stored in the assembly table. The relationships between contigs and chromosomes, and between contigs and supercontigs, are stored in the assembly table. </description>

      <description>Describes how contig sequences make up the chromosomal sequence. The data in this table defines the "static golden path", i.e. the best effort draft full genome sequence as determined by the UCSC or NCBI (depending which assembly you are using)  Each row represents a contig (raw_id, FK from contig table) at least part of  which is present in the golden path. The part of the contig that is in the path is delimited by fields raw_start and raw_end and the absolute position within the golden path chromosome (chromosome_id) is given by chr_start and chr_end. Each contig is in a "supercontig" such as a "fingerprint clone contig" or NT contig and the super contig is identified by the superctg_name column and the position of the specified section of the contig  within its supercontig is given by fields superctg_start and superctg_end. </description>

The differences between co-ordinate systems lie in where a particular numbered base lies, and the start position it is relative to. CONTIG co-ordinates, also called 'raw contig' co-ordinates or 'clone fragments' are relative to the first base of the first contig of a clone. Note that the numbering is from 1, i.e. the very first base of the first contig of a clone is numbered 1, not 0. In CHROMOSOMAL co-ordinates, the co-ordinates are relative to the first base of the chromosome. Again, numbering is from 1. The seq_region table can store sequence regions in any of the co-ordinate systems defined in the coord_system table."/>
