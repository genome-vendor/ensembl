Installation:
------------

This package uses GNU autoconf generated configure scripts, see the
file INSTALL.configure for generic configure documentation.

Pre-requisites:
--------------

You'll need to install 2 extra libraries that are used by the toolkit:

* The Boost C++ libraries or boost for short (http://www.boost.org)
  which provides free portable libraries compatible with standard
  libraries.
  We currently rely on boost version 1.47.0. 
  This version can be downloaded at:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/ 

* Log for C++ library or Log4cpp for short.
	Log4cpp is a library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files, 
	syslog, IDSA and other destinations.
	See the page of the project on SourceForge:
	http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/

To install Boost:
----------------

Remember that you will need to have bjam installed.

If you don't, install Boost.Build from an official release or a nightly build, as available on the official web site, 
following these steps:

1. Get a release from http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/
   For instance:
    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost-build-2.0-m12.tar.bz2

2. Unpack the release. 

3. On the command line, go to the root of the unpacked tree.

4. cd boost-build/jam_src

5. ./build.sh gcc (if you use gcc)


Then install Boost:

1. Download the latest version of Boost.
      
2. Unpack the release

3. On the command line, go to the root of the unpacked tree like
	 cd boost_1_47_0

4. Copy the version of bjam you've just build to this root
   For instance: 
	 cp boost-build/jam_src/bin.linuxx86_64/bjam boost_1_47_0/
  
5. ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=PREFIX

   where PREFIX is a directory where you want Boost libraries to be  
   installed.

6. ./b2


To install Log4cpp:
------------------

1. Get the latest version:

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/log4cpp/log4cpp-1.0.x%20%28current%29/log4cpp-1.0/log4cpp-1.0.tar.gz

2. Extract the sources:

  tar zxvf log4cpp-1.0.tar.gz

3. On the command line, go to the root of the unpacked tree.

  cd log4cpp-1.0

4. Run configure:
  ./configure --prefix=PREFIX

 where PREFIX is a directory where you want Log4cpp libraries to be  
   installed.

5. type the following commands
  make
  make test
  make install

It's possible that some of the modules won't compile with g++
From my experience, it's trivial to edit the code to fix the problems
(casting, includes directive order).

AltSplicingToolkit:
------------------

Once Boost and Log4cpp are installed, simply type:

./configure --prefix=<altsplicingtoolkit installation path> \
--with-boost-include=<boost installation path>/include/boost \
--with-boost-lib=<boost installation path>/lib \
--with-log4cpp=<log4cpp installation path>

Example:
./configure --prefix=/softwares/AltSplicingToolkit-0.5.4 \
--with-boost-include=/softwares/boost_1_47_0/include \
--with-boost-lib=/softwares/boost_1_47_0/lib \
--with-log4cpp=/softwares/log4cpp-1.0

make

and (as root)

make install
