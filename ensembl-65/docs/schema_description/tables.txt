==Introduction==

This document gives a high-level description of the tables that make up the EnsEMBL core schema. Tables are grouped into logical groups, and the purpose of each table is explained. It is intended to allow people to familiarise themselves with the schema when encountering it for the first time, or when they need to use some tables that they've not used before. Note that while some of the more important columns in some of the tables are discussed, this document makes no attempt to enumerate all of the names, types and contents of every single table. Some concepts which are referred to in the table descriptions are given at the end of this document; these are linked to from the table description where appropriate.Different tables are populated throughout the gene build process:

||Step||Process||
||0||Create empty schema, populate meta table||
||1||Load DNA - populates dna, clone, contig, chromosome, assembly tables||
||2||Analyze DNA (raw computes) - populates genomic feature/analysis tables||
||3||Build genes - populates exon, transcript,etc. gene-related tables||
||4a||Analyze genes - populate protein_feature, xref tables, interpro||
||4b||ID mapping||

This document refers to version ''20'' of the EnsEMBL core schema. You are looking at revision ''1.5''of this document.

== Fundamental tables ==

    
    

    
===seq_region===
Stores information about sequence regions. The primary key is used as a pointer into the dna table so that actual sequence can be obtained, and the coord_system_id allows sequence regions of multiple types to be stored. Clones, contigs and chromosomes are all now stored in the seq_region table. Contigs are stored with the co-ordinate system 'contig'. The relationship between contigs and clones is stored in the assembly table. The relationships between contigs and chromosomes, and between contigs and supercontigs, are stored in the assembly table. 
'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * dna - 1:1 relationship to the dna table.
 * coord_system - Describes which co-ordinates a particular feature is stored in.

    

    
===coord_system===
Stores information about the available co-ordinate systems for this species. Note that there must be one co-ordinate system that has the attribute "top_level" and one that has the attribute "sequence_level".
'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * seq_region - Has coord_system_id foreign key to allow joins with the coord_system table.
   
    

    
===seq_region_attrib===
Allows "attributes" to be defined for certain seq_regions. Provides a way of storing extra information about particular seq_regions without adding extra columns to the seq_region table. e.g. 
'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * seq_region - 
 * attrib_type - Provides codes, names and desctriptions of attribute types.

    

    
===attrib_type===

'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * seq_region_attrib - Associates seq_regions with attributes.

    

    
===dna===
Contains DNA sequence. This table has a 1:1 relationship with the contig table.
'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * seq_region - Relates sequence to features.
 * external_synonym - Allows xrefs to have more than one name

    

    
===dnac===
Stores compressed DNA sequence.
    
    

    
===assembly===
Describes how contig sequences make up the chromosomal sequence. The data in this table defines the "static golden path", i.e. the best effort draft full genome sequence as determined by the UCSC or NCBI (depending which assembly you are using)  Each row represents a contig (raw_id, FK from contig table) at least part of  which is present in the golden path. The part of the contig that is in the path is delimited by fields raw_start and raw_end and the absolute position within the golden path chromosome (chromosome_id) is given by chr_start and chr_end. Each contig is in a "supercontig" such as a "fingerprint clone contig" or NT contig and the super contig is identified by the superctg_name column and the position of the specified section of the contig  within its supercontig is given by fields superctg_start and superctg_end. 
'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * seq_region - Stores extra information about both the assembled object and its component parts

Concepts:

 * supercontigs  - The mapping between contigs and supercontigs is also stored in the assembly table.

    

    
===assembly_exception===
Allows multiple sequence regions to point to the same sequence, analogous to a symbolic link in a filesystem pointing to the actual file. This mechanism has been implemented specifically to support haplotypes and PARs, but may be useful for other similar structures in the future.
'''See also:'''


Tables:

 * assembly - 

    

    
===karyotype===

===transcript===
Stores information about transcripts. Has seq_region_start, seq_region_end and seq_region_strand for faster retrieval and to allow storage independently of genes and exons. Note that a transcript is usually associated with a translation, but may not be, e.g. in the case of pseudogenes and RNA genes (those that code for RNA molecules).

    

    
===transcript_stable_id===
Relates transcript IDs in this release to release-independent stable identifiers.
'''See also:'''


Concepts:

 * stable_id  - Describes the rationale behind the use of stable identifiers.


    

    
===exon_transcript===

===translation===
Describes which parts of which exons are used in translation. The seq_start and seq_end columns are 1-based offsets into the *relative* coordinate system of start_exon_id and end_exon_id. i.e, if the translation starts at the first base of the exon, seq_start would be 1. Transcripts are related to translations by the transcript_id key in this table.

    

    
===translation_stable_id===
Relates translation IDs in this release to release-independent stable identifiers.
'''See also:'''


Concepts:

 * stable_id  - Describes the rationale behind the use of stable identifiers.



    

    
===supporting_feature===

===prediction_transcript===
Stores transcripts that are predicted by ab initio gene finder programs (e.g. genscan, SNAP). Unlike EnsEMBL transcripts they are not supported by any evidence.

    

    
===prediction_exon===
Stores exons that are predicted by ab initio gene finder programs. Unlike EnsEMBL exons they are not supported by any evidence.

== Features and analyses ==


    

    
===analysis===
Usually describes a program and some database that together are used to create a feature on a piece of sequence. Each feature is marked with an analysis_id. The most important column is logic_name, which is used by the webteam to render a feature correctly on contigview (or even retrieve the right feature). Logic_name is also used in the pipeline to identify the analysis which has to run in a given status of the pipeline. The module column tells the pipeline which Perl module does the whole analysis, typically a RunnableDB module.

Tables that don't fit anywhere else.

'''See also:'''

 ----
==Concepts==

''co-ordinates ''
: There are several different co-ordinate systems used in the EnsEMBL database and API. For every co-ordinate system, the fundamental unit is one base. The differences between co-ordinate systems lie in where a particular numbered base lies, and the start position it is relative to. CONTIG co-ordinates, also called 'raw contig' co-ordinates or 'clone fragments' are relative to the first base of the first contig of a clone. Note that the numbering is from 1, i.e. the very first base of the first contig of a clone is numbered 1, not 0. In CHROMOSOMAL co-ordinates, the co-ordinates are relative to the first base of the chromosome. Again, numbering is from 1. The seq_region table can store sequence regions in any of the co-ordinate systems defined in the coord_system table.
''supercontigs ''
: A supercontig is made up of a group of adjacent or overlapping contigs.
''sticky_rank ''
: The sticky_rank differentiates between fragments of the same exon; i.e for exons that span multiple contigs, all the fragments would have the same ID, but different sticky_rank values
''stable_id ''
: Gene predictions have changed over the various releases of the EnsEMBL databases. To allow the user to track particular gene predictions over changing co-ordinates, each gene-related prediction is given a 'stable identifier'. If a prediction looks similar between two releases, we try to give it the same name, even though it may have changed position and/or had some sequence changes.
''cigar_line ''
: This allows the compact storage of gapped alignments by storing the maximum extent of the matches and then a text string which encodes the placement of gaps inside the alignment. Colloquially inside Ensembl this is called a and its adoption has shrunk the number of rows in the feature table around 4-fold.
